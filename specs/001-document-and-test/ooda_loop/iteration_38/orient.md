# OODA Loop Iteration 38 - Orient

**Date:** 2025-01-14
**Focus:** Examples Directory Organization

## Analysis
Examples are important for:
1. Quick onboarding of new users
2. Demonstrating library capabilities
3. Providing copy-paste starting points
4. Testing library features work as documented

## Current Examples Assessment
- **basic_completion.rs**: Good starter, but OpenAI-specific
- **multi_provider.rs**: Good abstraction demo, covers 3 providers

## What README Should Include
1. Overview of examples
2. Prerequisites (API keys)
3. How to run each example
4. Description of what each example demonstrates
5. Links to related documentation

## Strategy
1. Create comprehensive examples/README.md
2. Document existing examples thoroughly
3. List future examples to be added
4. Reference provider-families.md for deeper info
