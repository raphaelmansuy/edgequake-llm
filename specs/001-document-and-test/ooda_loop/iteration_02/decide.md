# OODA Iteration 02 - Decide

## Decision

Create `docs/architecture.md` with:

1. High-level system diagram (ASCII)
2. Layer-by-layer explanation with WHY
3. Data flow for a typical request
4. Provider abstraction pattern
5. Middleware pipeline diagram
6. Cross-cutting concerns overview
7. Code references to source files

## Rationale

Architecture doc is the foundation for all other docs. External contributors
need this to understand the system before diving into specific features.
