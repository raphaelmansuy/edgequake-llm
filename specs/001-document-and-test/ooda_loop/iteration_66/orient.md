## Cross-Reference Matrix

| From Doc | Should Link To |
|----------|---------------|
| architecture | providers, provider-families, performance-tuning, security |
| providers | provider-families, architecture, security, performance-tuning |
| caching | performance-tuning, cost-tracking |
| cost-tracking | performance-tuning, security |
| rate-limiting | performance-tuning, security |
| observability | security |

## Key Relationships
- Architecture → high-level overview, links to details
- Providers → specific setup, links to design docs
- New docs (performance, security) → referenced by all relevant docs
