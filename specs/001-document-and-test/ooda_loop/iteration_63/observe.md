**Total: 11 files**

## Missing Documentation
- **Performance Tuning**: No guide for optimizing latency, throughput, cost

## User Needs Assessment
- Developers need guidance on:
  - Reducing Time to First Token (TTFT)
  - Maximizing throughput with concurrent requests
  - Memory optimization for caching
  - Cost optimization strategies
  - Provider-specific performance tips
  - Benchmarking across providers

## Action
Create comprehensive performance-tuning.md covering all optimization strategies.
