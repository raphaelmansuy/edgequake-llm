# OODA Iteration 03 - Decide

## Decision

Create `docs/providers.md` covering all providers with:
- Feature comparison table
- Per-provider sections with env vars, models, code examples
- Grouped by deployment model (cloud, local, IDE, generic, testing)

## Rationale

Providers doc is highest-value user-facing documentation. Developers
need to quickly understand which provider to use and how to set it up.
