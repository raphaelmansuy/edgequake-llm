# Iteration 08 - Decide

## Decision
Create `docs/observability.md` covering:
1. Architecture diagram showing all four observability layers
2. TracingProvider usage, GenAI attributes table, content capture
3. GenAI events schema and message format
4. Middleware logging and metrics
5. InferenceMetrics streaming display
6. Jaeger connection guide
7. Environment variable reference

## Rationale
Observability is critical for production deployments. Unified documentation prevents users from discovering these features piecemeal.
