# OODA-53 Decide

## Decision
Create retry_handling.rs example showing:
1. All RetryStrategy variants and their use cases
2. Factory methods for common scenarios
3. RetryExecutor with simulated failures
4. Error-to-strategy mapping

## Rationale
Proper error handling and retry logic is essential for reliable LLM applications. This example provides a comprehensive reference.

## No API Key Required
Uses simulated operations - runs locally without any cloud dependencies.
