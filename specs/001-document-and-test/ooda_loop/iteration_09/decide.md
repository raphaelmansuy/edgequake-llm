# Iteration 09 - Decide

## Decision
Create `docs/testing.md` covering:
1. Test architecture diagram (unit / integration / E2E layers)
2. Running tests (cargo test commands for different scopes)
3. MockProvider usage with code examples
4. MockAgentProvider usage for tool-calling agent tests
5. Common testing patterns (decorator, cache, rate limiter, reranker)
6. Coverage measurement (cargo-tarpaulin, cargo-llvm-cov)
7. Test file index with API key requirements
